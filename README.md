# Indexer and word search engine

> Status: Finished

 ### This work originated from a college project. It is a C code where it is possible to index a text file (.txt) into a data structure using either a binary tree or a linked list. It is also possible to search for words contained (or not) in the file after indexing, displaying the time in milliseconds for each operation performed in the program.

## How to run the application:

### Windows:
1. Obtain gcc on your machine's command prompt
2. Open your machine's command prompt and verify if gcc was installed correctly. (you can verify by running the command: gcc --version)
3. Run the command: gcc "<PathToYourFile.c>" -o <NameOfExitFile>
Note: <PathToYourFile.c> is the path to the C file on your computer. <NameOfExitFile> is the name of the exit file.
4. Run the command: <NameOfExitFile> "<PathToYourFile.txt>" <DesiredIndex>
Note: <PathToYourFile.txt> is the path to the txt file on your computer. And <DesiredIndex> corresponds to: "tree" or "list".
